##  1.1 More than the sum of their parts

> while many real-world structures are compositional, the results of observing them are often not

> The result is that observation is inherently "lossy": in order to extract information from something, one must drop the details.

> Out of all the functions `f: R -> R`, only some of them are order-preserving, only some of them are metric preserving, only some of them are addition preserving, etc.
> 1. order-preserving: if `x <= y` implies `f(x) <= f(y)`, forall `x,y in R`
> 2. metric-preserving: if `|x -y| = |f(x) - f(y)|`
> 3. addition-preserving: if `f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)`
>
> In category theory we want to keep control over which aspects of our systems are being preserved under our observation f.
