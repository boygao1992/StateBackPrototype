## Semantic (Model)

```haskell

-- | The type index 'Model' represents the model implementation.
data Model

-- Stream of events. Simultaneous events are grouped into lists.
newtype instance Event Model a = E { unE :: [[a]] }
--    [(Time, a)] -- original model from FRAnimation
-- ~> [(Time, [a])] -- NOTE introduce simultaneity
--  ~ Time -> [a] -- Time = Int
--  ~ [[a]]

--   Time -> Maybe a -- NOTE another common formulation of contingency effect in Event
-- ~ [Maybe a]

-- Stream of values that the behavior takes.
newtype instance Behavior Model a = B { unB :: [a] } -- Time -> a, function
--   Time -> a -- Time = Int
-- ~ [a]

------------------
-- Class interface

data family Event f    :: * -> *
data family Behavior f :: * -> *

class
  ( Functor (Event f)
  , Functor (Behavior f)
  , Applicative (Behavior f)
  ) => FRP f where

    -- | Event that never occurs.
    -- Think of it as @never = []@.
    never    :: Event f a

    -- | Merge two event streams of the same type.
    -- In case of simultaneous occurrences, the left argument comes first.
    -- Think of it as
    --
    -- > union ((timex,x):xs) ((timey,y):ys)
    -- >    | timex <= timey = (timex,x) : union xs ((timey,y):ys)
    -- >    | timex >  timey = (timey,y) : union ((timex,x):xs) ys
    union    :: Event f a -> Event f a -> Event f a

    -- | Apply a time-varying function to a stream of events.
    -- Think of it as
    --
    -- > apply bf ex = [(time, bf time x) | (time, x) <- ex]
    apply    :: Behavior f (a -> b) -> Event f a -> Event f b


    -- | Allow all events that fulfill the predicate, discard the rest.
    -- Think of it as
    --
    -- > filter p es = [(time,a) | (time,a) <- es, p a]
    filter   :: (a -> Bool) -> Event f a -> Event f a

    -- | Allow all events that fulfill the time-varying predicate, discard the rest.
    -- It's a slight generalization of 'filter'.
    filterApply :: Behavior f (a -> Bool) -> Event f a -> Event f a

    -- Accumulation.
    -- Note: all accumulation functions are strict in the accumulated value!
    -- acc -> (x,acc) is the order used by  unfoldr  and  State

    -- | Construct a time-varying function from an initial value and
    -- a stream of new values. Think of it as
    --
    -- > stepper x0 ex = \time -> last (x0 : [x | (timex,x) <- ex, timex < time])
    --
    -- Note that the smaller-than-sign in the comparision @timex < time@ means
    -- that the value of the behavior changes \"slightly after\"
    -- the event occurrences. This allows for recursive definitions.
    --
    -- Also note that in the case of simultaneous occurrences,
    -- only the last one is kept.
    stepper :: a -> Event f a -> Behavior f a
    -- scanl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> [a]
    --       ~> (a -> [a] -> a) -> a -> [[a]] -> [a] -- b = [a]
    -- go :: a -> [a] -> a
    -- go x e = last (x:e)
    --
    -- stepper = scanl go :: a -> [[a]] -> [a]

    -- | The 'accumB' function is similar to a /strict/ left fold, 'foldl''.
    -- It starts with an initial value and combines it with incoming events.
    -- For example, think
    --
    -- > accumB "x" [(time1,(++"y")),(time2,(++"z"))]
    -- >    = behavior "x" [(time1,"xy"),(time2,"xyz")]
    --
    -- Note that the value of the behavior changes \"slightly after\"
    -- the events occur. This allows for recursive definitions.
    accumB   :: a -> Event f (a -> a) -> Behavior f a

    -- NOTE [Haskell/Foldable](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Foldable)
    -- foldr :: (a -> (b -> b)) -> b -> [a] -> b
    --       ~> (a -> (a -> a)) -> a -> [a] -> a -- degenerated
    --        ~ a -> [a -> a] -> a -- map over the list [a]
    --       ~? a -> f [a -> a] -> f a -- NOTE lift both into an effect f
    --        ~ a -> (Time -> [a -> a]) -> (Time -> a) -- f = (->) Time
    --        ~ a -> Event (a -> a) -> Behavior a

    -- | The 'accumE' function accumulates a stream of events.
    -- Note that the output events are simultaneous with the input events,
    -- there is no \"delay\" like in the case of 'accumB'.
    accumE   :: a -> Event f (a -> a) -> Event f a
    --       ~ a -> [a -> a] -> a
    --       ~ [a -> a] -> (a -> a)
    -- (a -> a) ~ Endo a
    -- instance Semigroup (Endo a) where (<>) = under Endo (<<<)
    -- instance Monoid (Endo a) where mempty = Endo identity
    --       = ala Endo foldMap

instance FRP f => Monoid (Event f a) where
  mempty  = never
  mappend = union

----------------------
-- Derived Combinators

-- | Variant of 'filterApply'.
whenE :: FRP f => Behavior f Bool -> Event f a -> Event f a

-- | Efficient combination of 'accumE' and 'accumB'.
mapAccum :: FRP f => acc -> Event f (acc -> (x,acc)) -> (Event f x, Behavior f acc)

--------------
-- Interpreter

-- | Slightly simpler interpreter that does not mention 'Time'.
-- Returns lists of event values that occur simultaneously.
run :: (Event Model a -> Event Model b) -> [a] -> [[b]]

-- | Interpreter that corresponds to your mental model.
type Time = Double
interpret :: (Event Model a -> Event Model b) -> [(Time,a)] -> [(Time,b)]

```

## Implementation (PushIO)

```haskell

data PushIO

-- type Event = Model.Event PushIO
newtype instance Model.Event PushIO a = Event (Event Accum a)

-- type Behavior = Model.Behavior PushIO
newtype instance Model.Behavior PushIO a = Behavior (Behavior Accum a)

------
-- AST

type family   Event t a
type instance Event Accum  a = (Ref (EventStore a), EventD Accum a)

type instance Event Linear a = EventD Linear a

type family   Behavior t a
type instance Behavior Accum  a = (Ref (BehaviorStore a), BehaviorD Accum a)
type instance Behavior Shared a = (Ref (BehaviorStore a), BehaviorD Linear a)
type instance Behavior Linear a = (Ref (BehaviorStore a), BehaviorD Linear a)

type Cache = [IO ()]
type Ref a = IORef (Maybe a)
type CacheRef a = IORef (Maybe  a)

  -- internal combinators
  Input         :: Typeable a => Channel -> EventD t a

## Compile Network AST

- 3-stage transpiling
  ```haskell
  Event Accum () -> Event Shared () -> [Event Linear a] -> [Path]
  ```
- compilation
  ```haskell
  Compile [Path] -> IO ([Path], Cache)
  ```

```haskell
type Store = IO
type Compile a = StateT Cache Store a
type Run = IdentityT IO

compile
  :: Event Accum () -- Program, discrete machine with Accum backend
  -> IO ([Path], Cache)
compile e
  = runStore :: Store ([Path], Cache) -> IO ([Path], Cache)
  $ runCompile :: Compile [Path] -> Store ([Path], Cache)
  $ return . map (compilePath :: Event Linear () -> Path)
  =<< compileUnion :: Event Shared a -> Compile [Event Linear a]
  =<< compileAccumB :: Event Accum () -> Compile (Event Shared ())
    $ e
```

## Setting up an event network

```haskell
type Channel  = Integer
type Universe = (Channel, Dynamic)

type AddHandler a = (a -> IO ()) -> IO ()
type AddHandler'  = (Channel, (Universe -> IO ()) -> IO ())
type Preparations = ([Model.Event PushIO (IO ())], [AddHandler'])
newtype Prepare a = Prepare
  { unPrepare :: RWST ()
                 Preparations -- Network
                 Channel -- auto-increment identifier for Channels
                 IO a }

-- Run
prepareEvents :: Prepare () -> IO ()
  where
    compileHandlers :: Model.Event PushIO (IO ()) -> IO [(Channel, Universe -> IO ())]
      where
        compile :: Event Accum () -> IO ([Path], Cache)
        groupChannelsBy :: (a -> a -> a) -> [(Channel, a)] -> [(Channel, a)]
    applyChannels :: [(Channel, a -> b)] -> [(Channel, a)] -> [(Channel, b)]

-- Input (Source)
fromAddHandler :: Typeable a => AddHandler a -> Prepare (Model.Event PushIO a)
  where
    toUniverse :: Typeable a => Channel -> a -> Universe
    input :: Typeable a => Channel -> Model.Event PushIO a
      where
        event :: EventD Accum a -> Model.Event PushIO a

-- Output (Sink)
reactimate :: Model.Event PushIO (IO ()) -> Prepare ()

```

> Prepare
>
>     After having read all about 'Event's and 'Behavior's,
>     you want to hook things up to an existing event-based framework,
>     like @wxHaskell@ or @Gtk2Hs@.
>     How do you do that?
>
>     To do that, you have to use the 'Prepare' monad.
>     The typical setup looks like this:
>
> ```haskell
> main = do
>   ... -- other initialization
>
>   -- initialize event network
>   prepareEvents $ do
>       -- obtain  Event  from functions that register event handlers
>       emouse    <- fromAddHandler (registerMouseEvent window)
>       ekeyboard <- fromAddHandler (registerKeyEvent window)
>
>       -- build event network
>       let
>           behavior1 = accumB ...
>           ...
>           event15 = union event13 event14
>
>       -- animate relevant event occurences
>       reactimate $ fmap print event15
>       reactimate $ fmap drawCircle eventCircle
>
>   ... -- start the GUI framework here
> ```
>
>     In short, you use 'fromAddHandler' to obtain /input events/;
>     the library will register corresponding event handlers
>     with your event-based framework.
>
>     To animate /output events/, you use the 'reactimate' function.
>
>     The whole setup has to be wrapped into a call to 'prepareEvents'.
>
>     The 'Prepare' monad is an instance of 'MonadIO',
>     so 'IO' is allowed inside. However, you can't pass anything
>     of type @Event@ or @Behavior@ outside the 'prepareEvents' call;
>     this is intentional.
>     (You can probably circumvent this with mutable variables,
>     but there is a 99,8% chance that earth will be suspended
>     by time-traveling zygohistomorphisms
>     if you do that; you have been warned.)
