[elm-lang/core/2.1.0](https://github.com/elm-lang/core/blob/2.1.0/src/Signal.elm)

Elm used to have `Signal` from FRP which emphasized reactive programming style

to me, still a better way to define dependencies than Push-based syntax.

TODO: investigate original implementation and figure out a way to merge "Reducer"s in Pull-based syntax.

[Folding Time with Signals in Elm (and then never doing that again) â€” David Crespo @ OSCON 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atAjwA6BycM)

Elm runtime (before 0.17) provides a set of primitive `Signal`s for DOM, HTTP, Websocket, etc.
